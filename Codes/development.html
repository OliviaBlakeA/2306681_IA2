                    <td>Chapter 4: Goal Setting</td>
                    <td>
                        Goal setting takes you out of stagnation. Writing down your goals increases the likelihood of achieving them because it keeps your mind focused. The true value of setting goals lies not just in their achievement but in who you become along the journey.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        This chapter threw me for six! I realized that without clear goals, I was just drifting through life. Writing goals down not only makes them real but also helps my mind focus on achieving them.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        I’ll write down 100 life goals and break them into smaller steps, keeping me focused on growth and becoming the person I aim to be.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Write down 100 life goals.</li>
                            <li>Break goals into smaller, actionable steps.</li>

                    <td>Chapter 5: Proper Use of Time</td>
                    <td>
                        Time management is essential. We must all suffer from one of two pains: discipline or regret. Prioritizing important tasks over urgent but less meaningful ones leads to long-term success.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Time management has always been tricky for me, but this chapter flipped a switch. I realized how often I spend time on urgent things instead of focusing on what’s truly important.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        I’ll focus on prioritizing important tasks—like studying and personal projects—over what feels urgent to avoid regret later.

                    <td>Chapter 6: Surrounding Yourself With the Best People</td>
                    <td>
                        The people you surround yourself with significantly impact your growth. Categorize people into disassociation, limited association, and expanded association based on their influence on your personal development.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        This chapter was a game changer. It made me think about whether I’m surrounding myself with people who lift me up or just those who are convenient.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        I’ll intentionally surround myself with people who challenge and inspire me to grow. It’s time to evaluate my social circle and act accordingly.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expand associations with people who inspire growth.</li>
                            <li>Limit or disassociate from those who don’t align with my goals.</li>

                    <td>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</td>
                    <td>
                        Life-long learning is key. Formal education makes a living, but self-education makes a fortune. The three ways to learn are reading, observing successful people, and reflecting on your experiences.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        I’ve always loved learning, but this chapter brought it home. Formal education sets the foundation, but self-education is where the magic happens.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        I’ll commit to never stop learning—by reading more books, observing successful people, and reflecting on life lessons.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read regularly to expand my knowledge.</li>
